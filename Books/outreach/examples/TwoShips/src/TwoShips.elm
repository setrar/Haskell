-- track of both where they are, and where they are headed (their velocity)

-- the definition of velocity is the change in the position in a unit of time
-- the definition of acceleration is the change in the velocity in a unit of time
-- Wow!  Those sound very similar.

-- We only need function to make the change needed over one unity of time.
-- We will use the time between Ticks as the unit of time, although
-- this is not a great unit of time, since Ticks come more slowly when
-- your computer is busy, or just gets slow.

-- You aren't supposed to know about this defintion of velocity until grade 11,
-- so don't tell anyone we told you.

-- we don't need to use any notifyTap or notifyTapAt in this type of game
